Project Proposal: IoT System for Air Pollution Monitoring 
1.	Introduction 
This project proposes the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring air pollution. The system will utilize a NodeMCU microcontroller, Arduino Uno, and various sensors to collect real-time air quality data. The collected data will be uploaded to a cloud platform for remote access and visualization. 
2.	Project Idea 
The project aims to create a portable air quality monitoring system that can be deployed in various locations. Users can remotely access and analyze the collected data to understand air quality variations. This information can be used for environmental research, personal health awareness, and pollution control efforts. 
3.  Project Objectives 
1.	Design and build an IoT system for air pollution monitoring.
2.	Integrate sensors (MQ135, MQ7, DHT22) to measure air quality parameters (CO2, CO, NH3, Ozone, Temperature, and Humidity). 
3.	Utilize a NodeMCU microcontroller for data processing and communication.
4.	Upload collected air quality data to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak, Adafruit IO, Blynk).
5.	 Develop a user interface for remote data visualization and access.
